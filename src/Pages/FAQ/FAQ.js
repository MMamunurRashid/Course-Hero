          Theory of computation (TOC) is a branch of Computer Science that is
          concerned with how problems can be solved using algorithms and how
          efficiently they can be solved.The essence of the theory of
          computation is to help develop mathematical and logical models that
          run efficiently and to the point of halting. Since all machines that
          implement logic apply TOC, studying TOC gives learners an insight into
          computer hardware and software limitations.

          Learning compiler design techniques for large projects help you
          develop special-purpose languages that make the project easy to
          implement. Studying compilers enables you to design and implement your
          domain-specific language. Learning compilers gives you theoretical and
          practical knowledge to implement a programming language.A study of
          compiler design teaches you how a large problem can be broken down and
          solved in a structured manner. Understanding compilers and how they
          work makes it simple for you to debug, simulate and create 3D
          applications and browsers. The study of compiler design also provides
          a gentle introduction to formal methods.Learning compilers offer a
          good opportunity to get experience with developing a larger piece of
          software.

          System analysis and design is a process that many companies use to
          evaluate particular business situations and develop ways to improve
          them through more optimal methods. Companies may use this process to
          reshape their organization or meet business objectives related to
          growth and profitability. System analysis and design also typically
          emphasize how systems act, their relationships to other subsystems and
          the ability of both to meet a specific goal. This often involves
          analyzing a system's performance and the quality of its output.

          It helps you understand how a computer works By learning C, you can be
          able to understand and visualize the inner workings of computer
          systems. This can include aspects like allocation and memory
          management along with their architecture and the overall concepts that
          drive programming. As a programming language, C also allows you to
          write more complex and comprehensive programs. When you understand how
          a computer works, you can better design applications and sites to
          optimize user experience.

          C# is designed to be a high-level language. This means it takes care
          of a lot of the code you would have to write in other languages like
          Java and C++. Plus, it provides you with libraries that make writing
          code quicker and easier. C# is in demand. Thousands of enterprises use
          Microsoft technologies in their infrastructure, and even when they
          don't, C# is still a popular language for creating web services. C# is
          now open-source and cross-platform. When it first came out, C# was
          designed specifically for Windows, but now you can also run C# on the
          Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. C# is relatively easy to learn.
          Since it omits many of the complex tasks in programming, a programmer
          doesn't have to worry about these potential issues ahead of time and
          can just start coding. C# is fast. Because it’s a statically typed
          language, it’s easier to make fast code, and it can tackle larger
          tasks more efficiently. In other words, you can write high-performance
          apps in C# at a relatively fast speed.
